The concept of clustering datasets.  
1) In order to make clustering of datasets, 3 points (i.e., A(3, 3), B(11, 11), C(25, 25)) are given as datum points. Let us call any point close to the point A is belong to the cluster A. Any point close to the point B is belong to the cluster B. Any point close to the point C is belong to the cluster C.
2) A given datasets (i.e., test1112.csv) have to be measured of the distances between these 3 datum points and a point from the datasets. Pythagoras theorem can be used to calculate the distances. 
3) The 3 distances from a point of the datasets should be compared and find out the shortest distance from this point. The shortest distance identifies a particular point is belong to whether the cluster A or the cluster B or the cluster C. 

My python code is not working properly however I wrote the code based on the concept above. 

I plotted 4 plots based on the 3 CSV files (data-1csv, data-2.csv, and data-3.csv) from the class and test1112.csv which I have been using for my python code for this assignment. All these plots were created by running the code provided by the professor in the class.
